Data_processor for dataset version 3: extract multiple features from audio (Chroma STFT, mfcc, etc.) and only store their mean values.
Each audio numpy contains too many features (features.shape: (194, 1) ), the size of data_v2 is 24.5 MB.
The preprocessed dataset doesn't help the model achieve better performance on test set (details are included in resnet_v3: "training_log"),
therefore at the end I didn't use the results which based on data_v3. To save file size, I do not include preprocessed data in this file.
